# Introduction

ZoomIt is a zoom, annotation, and screen recording tool for technical presentations that include app demos. 
ZoomIt runs discreetly in the tray and is activated with customizable hotkeys to zoom in on an area of the screen, move while zoomed in, 
and draw on the enlarged image. I wrote ZoomIt to meet my specific needs and use it in all my presentations.

ZoomIt works on all versions of Windows and you can use touch and pen input for ZoomIt drawing on tablets.

# Using ZoomIt

The first time you run ZoomIt, it will present you with a configuration dialog box that describes the behavior of ZoomIt, 
we will specify alternate shortcut keys for zooming and to enter drawing mode without zooming, and customize the color and size of the drawing pen. 
I use the draw without zoom option to annotate the screen at its native resolution, for example. 
ZoomIt also includes an interrupt timer feature that remains active even when you move away from the timer window and allows 
you to return to the timer window by clicking the ZoomIt tray icon.
